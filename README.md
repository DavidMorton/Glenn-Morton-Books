## Public Domain books by Glenn Morton

My father, Glenn Morton, changed his views on creation and evolution multiple times in his life. He struggled with his faith mightily as he worked to harmonize his faith with the facts that he saw in his work as a geophysicist. The fruit of his labor culminated in two books, both written in his middle age:

Adam, Apes and Anthropology (1997, ISBN 0-9648227-2-5)

Foundation, Fall and Flood (1994, ISBN 0-9648227-1-7)

In 2015, after having rejected his own views in the book, he decided to release them into the public domain, and as such, he posted the PDFs of his book on his website. Later, fearing that this may harm the faith of some people, he subsequently removed them from his website. Nevertheless, the PDF copies were out, and there are those who are repackaging and selling his books online. While I cannot stop them, given that my father had turned his book over to the public domain, I can join them, and provide them free of charge to all who are interested. 

My hope and prayer is that you will use these books to research and strengthen your faith in Christ and think through archeological, geological, and philosophical questions of the Bible. While it is my opinion that the Bible was never meant to be taken as a science textbook, nor was it intended to outline a scientific, detailed account of the events of creation, this was not my father's stance, and hence the existence of these two books. This is a major part of his life's work.

So it is with joy that I offer you these two books, freely and without charge.
