## Public Domain books by Glenn Morton

My father, Glenn Morton, changed his views on creation and evolution multiple times in his life. He struggled with his faith mightily as he worked to harmonize his faith with the facts that he saw in his work as a geophysicist. The fruit of his labor culminated in two books, both written in his middle age:

Adam, Apes and Anthropology (1997, ISBN 0-9648227-2-5)

Foundation, Fall and Flood (1994, ISBN 0-9648227-1-7)

In 2015, he decided to release them into the public domain and posted the PDFs of the books on his website. Later, around 2018, his views began to change, and fearing the negative effects his books may have on the faith of some, he subsequently removed them from his website. Nevertheless, the PDF copies were out, and there are some who are repackaging and selling his books online. While we cannot stop them, given that my father had turned his book over to the public domain, we can at least reduce the profiteering by providing them free of charge to all who are interested.

His views, at the time of his death, are best represented by his book Eden was Here: New Evidence for the Historicity of Genesis, which you can find [here](https://www.amazon.com/Eden-was-Here-Evidence-Historicity/dp/B08DSX3GLX).

My hope and prayer is that you will use these books to research and strengthen your faith in Christ and think through archeological, geological, and philosophical questions of the Bible. While it is my opinion that the Bible was never meant to be taken as a science textbook, nor was it intended to outline a scientific, detailed account of the events of creation, this was not my father's stance, and hence the existence of these two books, and his later book Eden Was Here. These books remain as a testament to the changing views my father held over the years.

So it is with joy that I offer you these two books, freely and without charge.
